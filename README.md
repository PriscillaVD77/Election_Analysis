Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
This script can be modified for future election with a few modification. This can be applied to different data sets by changing the csv file.

We will need to modify the script variables and create new list and dictionaries but the formala can be repeatred for each string or numberic variable
