## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be modified for future election with a few modification. This can be applied to different data sets by changing the csv file and we can .<br>
<br>
![Import CSV](Resources/import_scs.png)<br>
<br>
We can reuse the code used in this script and use the same programming flow to find other factors that can tell us more about the election. We can use the following codes to look at different cariables. <br>

<br>
Depending on information given in the dataset, we can anlayze different factors such as states, cities, or district. We can also use this script to grab the demographic of voters for each candidate. We can collect information on socio-economic status, race, or political views. We will need to modify the script variables and create new list and dictionaries but the formala can be repeated to find new string or numberic variables. We can find these new variables by reusing our code and it can tell us more information about the election.
